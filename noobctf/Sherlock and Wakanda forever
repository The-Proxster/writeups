Downloaded the chall.zip file, and unzipped it.
Went into it, immediately panicked after seeing waht was in it.
Went into the first folder, realized it was just steganography. 
Phew, however I pray I don't have to suffer through doing it to over 50 images.
Found in first file: "Secret: TWF0Z"
Went into second, found another "Secret: SwgU"
I recognize this, seems like a 7rot cipher, but can't be sure. Now going to keep hold of all the secrets.

{
	0: TWF0Z
	1: SwgU
	10: CBjY
	100: WQgd
	101: Ghhd
	102: D8gb
	103: nZtL
	11: W4gY
	12: mUgd
	13: Ghpc
	14: yBly
}

They're in binary code I think
Nope.
Looks closer to hexadecimal? Oh god no.
